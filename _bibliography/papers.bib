  abstract={Artificial intelligence or big data technologies can benefit finance companies such as those in the insurance sector. With artificial intelligence, companies can develop better customer segmentation methods and eventually improve the quality of customer relationship management. However, the application of AI-based customer segmentation in the insurance industry seems to have been unsuccessful. Findings from our interviews with sales agents and customer service managers indicate that current customer segmentation in the Korean insurance company relies upon individual agents’ heuristic decisions rather than a generalizable data-based method. We propose guidelines for AI-based customer segmentation for the insurance industry, based on the CRISP-DM standard data mining project framework. Our proposed guideline provides new insights for studies on AI-based technology implementation and has practical implications for companies that deploy algorithm-based customer relationship management systems.}

  author={Kim, Taekyung and Lee*, Jaehwan and Suh, Jihae},
  journal={Displays},

  abstract={Advertising is significant in video streaming services on mobile devices, as well as in other e-business services. Advertisement providers pay part or the entire service cost; hence, users enjoy services at a low price or free of charge. However, users perceive advertisements as clutter and avoid them. To reduce advertising avoidance and enhance advertising efficiency, various methods, such as raising advertising relevance, seeking advertisement permission, or changing advertisement position, are suggested. This study introduces L-Shape advertising, a new strategy suitable for mobile video streaming services, as it is less distractive and effective. We demonstrate the superiority of L-Shape advertising compared to popular advertising formats such as skippable and non-skippable advertisements. The study empirically tests how the proposed strategy performs and examines users’ cognitive processes applying eye-tracking technology. We found that L-Shape advertising is less distractive but still effective.},

  abstract={With the emergence of high technologies, there is a constant need for facilitating the changes in our lives. Among them, the online platform economy has been growing remarkably for a decade. This paradigm created a new labor market suggested several alternative work arrangements because it mediated works that are very attractive to those who want to use their free time to make money. In the nearly two years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, online platform workers also experienced changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who advocate for online work claim that it provides career opportunities by providing resources like greater work autonomy and a high potential for work–nonwork integration, resulting in more boundaryless, individualized, and whole life careers. All these factors led us to consider how we work, what we value in our workplace, and what motivates us. Among them, motivation is one of the key roles of management because it leads to and sustains behavior. However, prior studies have focused on the theoretical description of platform work motivation, and little is known about motivation causality from a behavioral perspective. This study aims to identify what leads people to become involved in online platform work. In detail. this research examined survey results related to what makes workers dominant in the platform labor market and attempted to explain all the previous phenomena based on the background of self-determination theory.}
